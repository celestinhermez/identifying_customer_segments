# Identifying Customer Segments

This project was completed as part of Udacity's nanodegree to illustrate concepts in unsupervised learning (PCA and clustering more specifically). The goal was to identify customer segments within the German population and within the consumer base of a mail-order sales company. In doing so we can better understand who the firm's customers are so it can focus its effort on reaching those while not wasting efforts on people who are not likely to be interested.

This was a case study developed by Udacity in partnership with AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solutions who provided real world data. As such, I am not authorized to share the raw data, and the code included in the Jupyter notebook cannot be run. Yet, I still wanted to display this project here to highlight how unsupervised learning techniques can be used to provide valuable insights to businesses.

The Jupyter notebook (both in `ipynb` and `html` formats) describe the analysis conducted in this project. I followed the usual data science steps, outlined below.
